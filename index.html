  <h3 class="w3-center">WHAT IS  BIOTEACH ?</h3>
  <p>BIOTE(A)CH began in January 2023 for two years. It is coordinated by the Çanakkale Onsekiz Mart University (Türkiye) with 4 University partners and a Bio-tech company and an Ed-Tech Enterprise. The main objective of this project is to bridge the gap between the university and industry through the validated and research-grounded understanding of the realities of biotechnology education within Europe.</p>
	<p>Biotechnology has been a major industrial sector, especially since the beginning of the millennium and a great employment opportunity for young undergraduates. Undergraduate programmes that conventionally offer scientific knowledge and technical skills for research or laboratories should be dynamically oriented to function as a bridge between Academia and Industry. BIOTE(A)CH, therefore, aims to improve the employment potentials of undergraduates by fostering design thinking in students and delivering courses through flipped learning to transfer their knowledge into practice.</p>
	<br>
  <h3 class="w3-center">Project Introduction: Barriers  to Enhance Plant Resilience</h3>
	<h4>Purpose and Scope of the Project</h4>
	<p>Global warming poses serious threats to agricultural production and plant health by changing climate conditions around the world. In this context, our project called "Obstacles to Increasing Plant Resilience" aims to increase the resistance of plants against abiotic stress factors. By focusing especially on drought stress, we aimed to examine the genetic structures of plants and understand their resistance mechanisms.</p>
	<h4>Drought Resistance and Genetic Analysis</h4>
	<p>In the project, different plant species were selected and studies were carried out on drought-resistant and non-drought-resistant genetic structures. It is aimed to identify genes that are or are not resistant to drought stress and to analyze the functions and effects of these genes in detail. In this direction, gene editing is planned using CRISPR technology. In this process, gene regions that increase or decrease drought resistance were identified and appropriate guide RNA (gRNA) sequences were selected for these genes.</p>
	<h4>CRISPR Technology and gRNA Selection</h4>
	<p>CRISPR-Cas9 technology is a revolutionary method in the field of gene editing and offers the opportunity to make the desired changes in the genetic structure of plants. In our project, specific guide RNA sequences were designed to target genes affecting drought resistance. These sequences have been carefully selected to ensure that the CRISPR system cuts and edits the correct gene regions.</p>
	<h4>Scientific Contributions and Future Perspectives</h4>
	<p>Our project is seen as an important step in the field of plant genetics and resistance studies. Introducing genetic information regarding drought resistance to the literature will constitute a valuable resource for agricultural scientists and genetic engineers. Additionally, the results of this study will contribute to the development of agricultural policies that combat climate change.</p>
	<p>The website created within the scope of the project presents the findings and methodology in detail, making it accessible to the scientific community and anyone interested. Through this site, we aim to reach wider audiences and increase scientific interaction by sharing the results of our project.</p>

		<p>Drought-resistant genes in plants are genes used to enhance drought tolerance. These genes typically act on mechanisms such as increasing water retention capacity, reducing water loss, or enhancing more efficient water usage in plants.</p>
		<p>Guide RNA (gRNA) is a type of RNA molecule used in CRISPR-Cas systems. This molecule takes on the guiding role necessary for cutting or editing a targeted gene. gRNA binds to the targeted DNA sequence, and then, with the guidance of an enzyme like Cas9, DNA cutting or modification is facilitated. This technology is widely used in genetic editing studies and biotechnology.</p>

	<div class="w3-content w3-padding-top-32">
		<p>Genes that confer susceptibility to drought can result in reduced adaptation of plants to drought stress or quicker damage. These genes may diminish the plants' ability to retain water, increase water consumption, or provide inadequate response mechanisms to drought stress. Consequently, this scenario can negatively impact the growth and productivity of plants under drought conditions.</p>
